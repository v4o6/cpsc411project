This directory contains the generated parser. The only file in here that
is not generated should be the ExpressionParser.jj file.

The other files are generated by JavaCC. If you have installed the JavaCC 
plugin then the generated code will automatically be updated each time
you edit ExpressionParser.jj.  Refer to its documentation for
detailed instructions:
